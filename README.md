# Laptop Customizer
_Starter project for React course_

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


THINKFUL ASSIGNMENT: Thinking in React
Your task is to refactor this application using a more React style approach to the problem. Note the following, however:

the style is not very important, that is, try to keep the same style, but if you break it do not spend too much time on it and do not spend any time trying to improve the style.

All the functionality works so code to perform the various tasks have been written and you can just reuse that code. No need to write new code. If the app does not do something that you think it should then chances are the decision to leave it out was deliberate.

Start by breaking down the user interface into components and drawing a hierarchical tree of components. Once you are satisfied that you have sufficiently broken it down then decide on state and where it should live. Finally, add the interactivity.
